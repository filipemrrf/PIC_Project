To do a [[Pointwise Conversion]] analysis of our solutions, we compare 2 different solutions at the same points in space and time. This gives us a function of space and time that tells us how close our solutions are to each other at a given point $(t,x)$. Even though this doesn't tell us how good our convergence is (like [[Norm Convergence]] does), this lets us know whether or not our method is converging.

Apart from that, this analysis also makes it easy to identify mistakes in the implementation of our method (or in the method itself), as we can see if there is a particular region of our solutions that is diverging.

In this project, we develop a code capable of solving the Einstein equations in 3+1 dimensions with spherical symmetry, when given Cauchy initial conditions. We first solve the wave equation in 1+1 dimensions with periodic boundary conditions, obtaining a clean convergence. We follow by solving a non-linear wave equation in the same conditions as before, obtaining a clean convergence both with and without artificial Kreiss Oliger dissipation. We then solve the wave equation in spherical coordinates with spherical symmetry, also obtaining a clean convergence. Finally, we solve a first-order reduction of the 3+1 ADM evolution equations in spherical symmetry, with a constraint violating perturbation of the Minkowski spacetime as initial conditions.
